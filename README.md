# HotelSimulatie
For a school prject we had to create a hotel simulation that could show the fastest path trough the hotel by using pathfinding and elevator algorithms.

For this project we received a 7 as grade.

Initially the version control was handled by Visual Studio Team Foundation but for easier acces is now uploaded to Github.
